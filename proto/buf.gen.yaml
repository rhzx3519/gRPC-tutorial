#  1. If the paths=import flag is specified, the output file is placed in a directory named after the Go package's import path.
#  For example, an input file protos/buzz.proto with a Go import path of example.com/project/protos/fizz results in an
#  output file at example.com/project/protos/fizz/buzz.pb.go. This is the default output mode if a paths flag is not specified.

#  2. If the module=$PREFIX flag is specified, the output file is placed in a directory named after the Go package's import path,
#  but with the specified directory prefix removed from the output filename. For example, an input file protos/buzz.proto
#  with a Go import path of example.com/project/protos/fizz and example.com/project specified as the module prefix results
#  in an output file at protos/fizz/buzz.pb.go. Generating any Go packages outside the module path results in an error.
#  This mode is useful for outputting generated files directly into a Go module.

#  3. If the paths=source_relative flag is specified, the output file is placed in the same relative directory as the input
#  file. For example, an input file protos/buzz.proto results in an output file at protos/buzz.pb.go.
